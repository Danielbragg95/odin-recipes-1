   <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Buttered noodles are simple to make with your favorite pasta, butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, 
            and pepper for a quick and easy, kid-friendly dish. Fresh herbs and a little lemon juice could 
            be added to amp up the flavor. Perfect to serve either as-is or alongside steak, chicken, or 
            meatballs. It's such a delicious recipe, yet I get many questions on how to make it.</p>
